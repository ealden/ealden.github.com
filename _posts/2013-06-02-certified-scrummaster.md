title: "Certified ScrumMaster"

I found myself in [Bas Vodde's](http://blog.odd-e.com/basvodde/ "Bas Vodde") [Certified ScrumMaster course](http://odd-e.com/courses.php?id=201305Singapore "Certified ScrumMaster") a few weeks back.  This was my second time to attend his course, again as a participant, and my first time to attend in Singapore.  It was an interesting situation as I would see how Scrum, and thus the course, has changed over the years, as well as to participate with people from different nationalities.

Some observations with Scrum, the course, and the people I was with:

 * The course is now 3 days long instead of 2.  This allowed the course to position specific exercises at the end of each day for maximum effectiveness, as participants had more time to ponder and internalize them.

 * Participants now need to do some pre-work, which consisted of an online exam with the [Scrum Primer](http://scrumprimer.org "Scrum Primer") and [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org "Agile Manifesto") as required readings.  Participants now had some idea of Scrum before the course even starts, and this idea would be refined as the course progressed.

 * There is now a lot more content for the ScrumMaster role.  The course covered the areas a ScrumMaster should focus on as the Team and their organization adopts Scrum, as well as practical suggestions on how to be an effective ScrumMaster. This should provide more support for ScrumMasters especially new ones as they start off in their teams and organizations.

 * Product Backlog Refinement is now highlighted, as Scrum Teams should use this to review and manage their Product Backlogs. Before, we would do this in Planning part 1, and we couldn't commit due to time constraints.  Now, Scrum Teams would be able to discuss Product Backlog Items enough to gain confidence to commit, with Planning part 1 focused on feedback from the Review of the previous sprint.

 * Flipcharts were used a lot more in the discussions, and they were posted around the training area to remind participants as the course progressed.  This also meant that there was less focus on the slides, which I felt was better as flipcharts were more "animated" than "static" slides and thus more relevant to our discussions.

 * The discussions among the participants were as interesting as they come.  I do note that for the emphatic response activity the answers were not as emphatic as I would have expected.  I am not sure if this is because Filipinos are a lot more sensitive to these things, which gets overboard too often in my humble opinion.

 * [Pigs and Chickens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chicken_and_the_Pig "The Chiken and the Pig") are no longer part of Scrum.  Bud of MLBTix is as challenging as before.  Fat Burger is still as disgusting as ever.

 * The sound of a sheepdog varies depending on nationality.

Since this was my second time I knew most of the exercises and their outcomes.  This made sharing much harder as I would definitely influence discussions in my group.  I was asked if I was with the group or not, which I think was a fair question by one of my groupmates.  This is definitely something I should watch out for in the future.

This course was very helpful, as it allowed me to see how Scrum has evolved through the years, as well as provide a refresher for it.  Also, just like watching a movie for a second time, there were details that I noticed which I simply wasn't aware of the first time I attended this course.  Scrum has always been about transparency which requires courage to do the right things, and that has not always been an easy thing from my experience.  I look forward to applying what I have learned and relearned going forward.
